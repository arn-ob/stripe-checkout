## Stripe Account ID

An account ID is generated for you when you create your Stripe account. This is different from your account's name and uniquely identifies your account. 
You can find your account ID in your Account and Profile settings, or by searching “account ID” in the search bar.

```bash
https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard/basics#:~:text=An%20account%20ID%20is%20generated,ID%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20search%20bar.
